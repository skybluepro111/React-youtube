        <p><i>Thank you for contacting us to let us know your language preference. We are delighted to have you on board and hope you find the following information useful.</i></p>
        <p>You are already over 300 users enjoying Interprétame, and Google Analytics has revealed us you come from a variety of countries. </p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=25ap92o" target="_blank"><img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/25ap92o.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <p>Most of you visit us from Spanish-speaking countries, but some English-speaking countries begin to jump on the bandwagon. For the about 12% of users accessing from the US and UK, we released a new version of our<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVcho15TZX0&t">vídeo-tutorial in English</a></b> which can be accessed from both our Facebook page and our Youtube channel.</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVcho15TZX0&t"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DVcho15TZX0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEWCMQBEG5IWvKriqkDCQgBFQAAiEIYAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDqlNvhRZXIq_hVlinUDvEa6ohitA" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <br></br><p>Statistics have also allowed us to discover that most of you access from mobile devices, resolution for which Interprétame was until now not ready.</p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=24zf9eo" target="_blank"><img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/24zf9eo.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <br></br><p>To solve this and allow you to enjoy the tool even in your commuting time, <b>we have adapted the web application to mobile devices (Responsive)</b>.This is how Interprétame will look from your mobile phone.</p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2qxylc0" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.tinypic.com/2qxylc0.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>

        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=e66n92" target="_blank"><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/e66n92.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=fxh0cp" target="_blank"><img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/fxh0cp.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <br></br><p> With Android phones, you'll be able to access all functions; with iOS, although you'll be able to explore the application, read the articles and memorize the new vocabulary stored in your profile, you will not be able to store audios for the time being, because Apple devices do not allow access to the microphone. But do not worry, as soon as we can develop native applications for mobile phones, there will be no barriers to any operating system. </p>
        <p>Another one of the improvements we have added this week has been a <b>progress-notifier</b> next to the recorder that will let you know how long it will take to generate the audio from the moment you finish your interpretation. Speed will depend on the power of your computer.</p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=fa6245" target="_blank"><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/fa6245.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <br></br><p>As for the <b>participation in the forum</b>, some of you have expressed your interest in writing interesting articles for our digital magazine Revista digital and in presenting your Degree and Master's Thesis in our section (Mal) BenditoTFG, so we are eager to bring those sections to life in the coming months so that other users can meet you and enjoy your experiences and findings.</p>
        <p>If you are reading this and thinking you also have something to say, we want to hear it. Publish in our magazine or send us a short presentation of your thesis so that we can spread your work. </p>
        <p>As far as <b>acknowledgments</b> are concerned, the list calls for a separate post (we will do it): you shared our first video-tutorial on Facebook, LinkedIn and even on your personal sites and blogs; you recommended us to your Interpreting teachers, some of whom contacted us to inform us that they will use Interprétame in their classrooms; you reported errors and access problems that helped us add improvements, and you even recommended interesting speeches on Twitter.</p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2vtbbs4" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.tinypic.com/2vtbbs4.png" border="0" style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>
        <br></br><p>For all that, a million thanks to you all. We hope that little by little many more of you can benefit from the tool and start participating, recording Prets, publishing with us and enjoying all benefits Interprétame offers — which we continue working on to expand and improve.</p> 
        <p>We would also like to take this opportunity to inform you of a new section on the page, <b><a href='https://www.interpretame.com/wiki/'>"Wiki"</a></b>, where you will be able to access the most common questions and problems as well as all newsletters (also available from the forum).</p>
        <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=w0qtd2" target="_blank"><img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/w0qtd2.png" border="0" width='80%' style="border-radius: 8px;box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;margin:1%;"></a>  
        <br></br><p>To end with some big news, we are happy to announce that we have been invited to present Interprétame at the <b>International Congress liLETRAd 2017</b> that will be held in July in Seville. Many thanks to the organizers!</p>

        <p>Best regards, and as we always say: explore it, share it, and above all, enjoy it.</p>
        <p><i>In the section Notificaciones, you can access the content of this <a href='https://forums.interpretame.com/topic/7/seguimos-creciendo'>newsletter</a> and the  <a href='https://forums.interpretame.com/topic/6/crea-tu-primer-pret'>prevoius one</a> . They are in Spanish for now, but we are improving the tool to offer English versions and you can always contact us to receive all information in English, like you did now. In any case, we added you to our English mail-list for next newsletters. :)</i></p>
